Overview
SWRM is a decentralized AI system powered by four interconnected swarm models. Like a hive mind, each model functions as a specialized node, processing and sharing information across the network.

The visualization demonstrates the parallel processing architecture and how the swarm models collectively analyze, adapt, and generate responses through distributed intelligence.
